## What it is?

It is a smart contract in which users can fund native tokens to the owner of contract. It also keeps track of the funders and
how much they have donated. Owner can then withdraw the money whenever he/she want. This project is made with foundry, which
is the framework to create, test and deploy smart contract and it's blazingly fast!!
